## Introduction
Once you have automated acceptance tests in place, you are testing the business acceptance criteria of your application, that is, validating that it provides users with valuable functionality.

They typically run against every version of your software that passes the commit tests.

An individual acceptance test is intended to verify that the acceptance criteria of a story or requirement have been met.

A unit test aims to show that a single part of the application does what the programmer intends it to; this is by no means the same as asserting that a user has what they need.

---
## Why Is Automated Acceptance Testing Essential?
There has always been a great deal of controversy around automated acceptance tests.

Project managers and customers often think they are too expensive to create and maintain-which indeed, when done badly, they are.

Many developers believe that unit test suites created through test-driven development are enough to protect against regressions.

But, the cost of a properly created and maintained automated acceptance test suite is much lower than that of performing frequent manual acceptance and regression testing, or that of the alternative of releasing poor-quality software.

Some people in the Agile community advocate that a combination of unit and component tests and XP practices are sufficient but:
1. No other type of test proves that the application, running more or less as it would in production, delivers the business value its users are expecting
2. Unit and component tests do not test user scenarios and are thus incapable of ﬁnding the kinds of defects that appear when users put the application through a series of states in the course of interacting with it.

------
### How to Create Maintainable Acceptance Test Suites
Acceptance tests are derived from acceptance criteria, so the acceptance criteria for your application must be written with automation in mind and must follow the **INVEST** (independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable) principles:

Automated acceptance tests should always be layered:

<img src="assets/acceptance-tests-layers.png" width="500px">

Test implementations that refer directly to the application's API or UI are brittle, and even small changes to the UI will immediately break all the tests referring to the changed UI element. Such tests are often the output of record-and-playback-style test automation products, which is one of the main reasons automated acceptance tests are perceived as expensive.

------
### Testing against the GUI
Drawbacks of the GUI testing:
- Its rapid rate of change
- The complexity of scenario setup
  
  Many interactions to get the system into a state ready for the test itself
- Access to test results
- Untestable GUI technologies

---
## Creating Acceptance Tests
Start with the identiﬁcation of acceptance criteria by analysts, testers, and customers working together, and then talk about representing acceptance criteria in a form that can be automated.

------
### The Role of Analysts and Testers
The role of the business analyst is:
- Represent the customers and users of the system. They work with the customer to identify and prioritize requirements.
- Work with the developers to ensure that they have a good understanding of the application from the user's perspective. They guide developers to ensure that stories deliver the business value that they are meant to.
- Work with testers to ensure that acceptance criteria are speciﬁed properly, and to ensure that functionality developed meets these acceptance criteria and delivers the expected value.

The role of the testers is:
- Ensure that the current quality and production-readiness of the software being developed is understood by everybody on the delivery team, including the customer.
- Working with customers and analysts to deﬁne acceptance criteria for stories or requirements.
- Working with developers to write automated acceptance tests
- Performing manual testing activities such as exploratory testing, manual acceptance testing, and showcases

Not every team has separate individuals who perform these roles 100% of the time. Sometimes, developers act as analysts, or analysts act as testers. In Scrum teams, product owners may do the analyst jobs.

------
### Analysis on Iterative Projects
1. Initially, the analysts will work closely with testers and the customer to deﬁne acceptance criteria.
2. Once the acceptance criteria have been deﬁned, the analyst and tester sit with the developers who will do the implementation, along with the customer if available. The tester works with the developers to agree on a collection of automated acceptance tests.
3. While the requirement is being implemented, the developers will consult with the analyst if they ﬁnd an area that they don't understand well enough, or if they have discovered a problem or a more efﬁcient approach to solving the problem that the requirement poses.
4. When the developers believe that they have completed the work (passed associated unit, component, and acceptance tests), they will demonstrate it to the analyst, the tester, and the customer.
5. Once the analyst and the customer are happy that the requirement has been fulﬁlled, it moves on to testing by the testers.

------
### Acceptance Criteria as Executable Speciﬁcations (BDD)
Acceptance tests are executable speciﬁcations of the behavior of the software being developed. This is a signiﬁcant realization which has spawned a new approach to automated testing, known as behavior-driven development (BDD).

In BDD, acceptance criteria should be written in the form of the customer's ex- pectations of the behavior of the application. It should then be possible to take acceptance criteria thus written, and execute them directly against the application to verify that the application meets its speciﬁcations.

Most speciﬁcations begin to become out-of-date as the application evolves. But, with BDD and deployment pipeline, it's not possible.

------
### Acceptance Criteria as Executable Speciﬁcations Example
Financial trading application acceptance criterion:

```
Feature: Placing an order
    Scenario: User order should debit account correctly
    Given there is an instrument called bond
    And there is a user called Dave with 50 dollars in his account
    When I log in as Dave
    And I select the instrument bond
    And I place an order to buy 4 at 10 dollars each
    And the order is successful
    Then I have 10 dollars left in my account
```

Ruby corresponding implementation using Cucumber:

```ruby
require 'application_driver/admin_api'
require 'application_driver/trading_ui'

Before do
    @admin_api = AdminApi.new
    @trading_ui = TradingUi.new
end

Given /^there is an instrument called (\w+)$/ do |instrument|
    @admin_api.create_instrument(instrument)
end

Given /^there is a user called (\w+) with (\w+) dollars in his account$/ do |user, amount|
    @admin_api.create_user(user, amount)
end

When /^I log in as (\w+)$/ do |user|
    @trading_ui.login(user)
end

When /^I select the instrument (\w+)$/ do |instrument|
    @trading_ui.select_instrument(instrument)
end

When /^I place an order to buy (\d+) at (\d+) dollars each$/ do |  quantity, amount|
    @trading_ui.place_order(quantity, amount)
end

When /^the order for (\d+) of (\w+) at (\d+) dollars each is successful$/ do |quantity, instrument, amount|
    @trading_ui.confirm_order_success(instrument, quantity, amount)
end

Then /^I have (\d+) dollars left in my account$/ do |balance|
    @trading_ui.confirm_account_balance(balance)
end
```

You should implement the `AdminApi` and `TradingUi` drivers.

Running result:

```
Feature: Placing an order
1 scenario (1 passed)
7 steps (7 passed)
...
0m0.016s
```

These executable speciﬁcations can generally be turned into a document suitable for auditing using a simple, automated process.

## Doctests
TODO: Should be completed.

## The Application Driver Layer
The application driver layer is the layer that understands how to talk to your application-the system under test (SUT).

The API for the application driver layer is expressed in a domain language.

This is the same acceptance test written using a JUnit test:

```java
public class PlacingAnOrderAcceptanceTest extends DSLTestCase {
    @Test
    public void userOrderShouldDebitAccountCorrectly() {
        adminAPI.createInstrument("name: bond");
        adminAPI.createUser("Dave", "balance: 50.00");
        tradingUI.login("Dave");

        tradingUI.selectInstrument("bond");
        tradingUI.placeOrder("price: 10.00", "quantity: 4");
        tradingUI.confirmOrderSuccess("instrument: bond", "price: 10.00", "quantity: 4");

        tradingUI.confirmBalance("balance: 10.00");
    }
}
```

It is instructive to compare the example acceptance test in JUnit (internal DSL), above, to the one expressed in Cucumber in the previous slides (external DSL). Either of these approaches will work just ﬁne, and each has its pros and cons (being textual, relation with acceptance crietria, auto-completeness, IDE, additional tools, etc.)

------
### The Window Driver Pattern: Decoupling the Tests from the GUI
When implementing the window driver pattern, you should write the equivalent of a device driver for each part of your GUI:

<img src="assets/window-driver-pattern.png" width="500px">

Acceptance test without layering:

```java
@Test
public void shouldDeductPaymentFromAccountBalance() {
    selectURL("http://my.test.bank.url");
    enterText("userNameFieldId", "testUserName");
    enterText("passwordFieldId", "testPassword");
    click("loginButtonId");
    waitForResponse("loginSuccessIndicator");

    String initialBalanceStr = readText("BalanceFieldId");

    enterText("PayeeNameFieldId", "testPayee");
    enterText("AmountFieldId", "10.05");
    click("payButtonId");

    BigDecimal initialBalance = new BigDecimal(initialBalanceStr);
    BigDecimal expectedBalance = initialBalance.subtract(new BigDecimal("10.05"));
    Assert.assertEquals(expectedBalance.toString(), readText("BalanceFieldId"));
}
```

Refactored with the `AccountPanelDriver` as window driver (note the GUI control names in the entities and functions):

```java
@Test
public void shouldDeductPaymentFromAccountBalance() {
    AccountPanelDriver accountPanel = new AccountPanelDriver(testContext);

    accountPanel.login("testUserName", "testPassword");
    accountPanel.assertLoginSucceeded();

    BigDecimal initialBalance = accountPanel.getBalance();
    accountPanel.specifyPayee("testPayee");
    accountPanel.specifyPaymentAmount("10.05");
    accountPanel.submitPayment();

    BigDecimal expectedBalance = initialBalance.subtract(new BigDecimal("10.05"));

    Assert.assertEquals(expectedBalance.toString(), accountPanel.getBalance());
}
```

## Implementing Acceptance Tests
There is more to the implementation of acceptance tests than layering:
- Putting the application in a particular state, performing several actions on it, and verifying the results.
  - An atomic test creates all it needs to execute and then tidies up behind itself, leaving no trace except a record of whether it passed or failed (e.g. create a new account at the start of every test).
  - Otherwise, write defensive tests (check everything at the start) and use differential assertions.
- Prevent privilaged access or backdoors for tests.
- Handle asynchrony and timeouts in order to avoid ﬂakiness.
  - Has the test failed, or are we just waiting for the results to arrive?
  - Make the sequence of events embodying the test appear to be synchronous:
    - Prefer multiple small delays against a large delay.
- Test doubles are often required in order to allow any integration with external systems to be simulated.
  - Your acceptance testing should be focused on providing a controllable environment (we don't have this limit in UAT).
  - Create test doubles that represent the connection to all external systems that our system interacts with.
  - Build small suites of tests around each integration point, intended to run in an environment that does have real connections to these external systems.

  - Have one component of our system to represent all interactions with an external system (a gateway or adapter). It also helps to implement other patterns such as _circuit breaker_.

## The Acceptance Test Stage
Acceptance test suite should be run against every build that passes the commit tests. Later pipeline stages are most commonly
treated as a matter of human judgment.

For projects of extremely short duration with a small team, maybe four or fewer developers, it may be overkill-you might instead run a few end-to-end tests as part of a single-stage CI process.

For projects of extremely short duration with a small team, maybe four or fewer developers, it may be overkill-you might instead run a few end-to-end tests as part of a single-stage CI process.

But, it bears repeating that large projects start out as small projects, and by the time a project gets large, it is invariably too late to retro-ﬁt a comprehensive set of automated acceptance tests without a Herculean level of effort.

Tips for the acceptance test stage:
- Keeping Acceptance Tests Green
  - When an acceptance test breaks, the team needs to stop and immediately triage.
  - Determining what may have caused a speciﬁc acceptance test failure is not as simple as for a unit test.
- Deployment Tests
  - Choose to run a small selection of new smoke tests designed to assert that our environment (infrastructure tests or environment tests) -> Known-good starting point for the execution of the more functional acceptance tests.
  - This tests are prioritized and fail-fast.

## Acceptance Test Performance
Ultimately it is more important to have a comprehensive automated test suite than one that runs in ten minutes.

But, the longer the time between the point where a problem is introduced and the point of discovering it, the more difﬁcult it will be to ﬁnd the source of the problem and ﬁx it:

- Refactor and Improve Common Tasks and Initial States
- Share Expensive Resources
- Parallel Testing and Using Compute Grids

---
## Summary
Automated acceptance tests are usually more complex than unit tests. They take more time to maintain, and they will probably spend more of their life being broken than unit tests.

The use of automated acceptance testing will pay for itself many times over; we have never regretted their use.
