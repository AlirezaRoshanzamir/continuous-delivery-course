## Introduction
**Scripting building**, **testing**, and **packaging** is essential for large or distributed teams to quickly onboard new members.

Modern platforms offer **command-line build options**. Rails uses **Rake**, .NET relies on **MSBuild**, and Java has **Ant, Maven, Buildr, or Gradle**. C/C++ projects benefit from **CMake** or **SCons**. Just have your CI server run these commands to build and test.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph custom" -->

As your project becomes more complex with **multiple components** or **unusual packaging** needs, you'll need to delve into build scripting.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph custom" -->

**Deploying software** to testing and production environments **isn't as simple as dropping a binary file**. It involves **configuring** your application, **initializing data**, setting up **infrastructure**, and more, including **mock external systems**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph custom" -->

---
## An Overview of Build Tools
Build tools have a common core: **modeling dependencies**:

<img src="assets/build-dependency-network.webp">

------
### Continued: An Overview of Build Tools
Build tool types:
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Task-oriented
  - Explain the dependency network using a set of tasks
  - Examples: Ant, NAnt, MSBuild
  - Don't retain state between builds, making it unsuitable for C++ compilation
  - Work well with languages like C# because their compilers have built-in logic for incremental builds.
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Product-oriented
  - Explain things based on the products they generate
  - Examples: Make (also supports _phony targets_ like install), Bazel, Pants, and Buck (these three are almost mixed)
  - Maintain their state using timestamps on the generated files from each task.
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Mixed
  - Such as Rake

<summary>Note</summary>
Mention the _cookie targets_ in Make.

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Make
A strong, **product-oriented** build tool that tracks dependencies and **only builds affected components**.

But, **it's hard to debug** complex Makefiles. In larger codebases, teams often create a Makefile for each directory and use a top-level Makefile to run them **recursively**, a practice that's [considered problematic](https://accu.org/journals/overload/14/71/miller_2004/): <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-parent-with-next custom" -->
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/makefile-example.webp" width="600"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/recursive-makefile.webp" width="250"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some other drawbacks:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->
- OS specific (it depends on the shell)
- Whitespace can be important in some cases
- Doesn't support extensions

<img src="assets/makefile-syntax-meme.webp" class="fragment end" width="800">

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Ant
Ant's core is in Java, while its scripts are an **external DSL in XML**. This mix provides Ant with robust **cross-platform** capabilities:
<img src="assets/ant-example.webp" width="750">

Some shortcomings:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->
- **XML** is **not concise** or **enjoyable** for humans to read.  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue-parent custom" -->
- There are **no real domain concepts** beyond tasks.  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue-parent custom" -->
- You can't easily respond to questions like **"How many tests ran?"** or **"How long did they take?"**.  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue-parent custom" -->
- Import and macrodef tasks support reuse but may be **confusing for novices**.  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue-parent custom" -->

Ant files can become very long and disorganized due to these limitations, sometimes extending to **thousands of lines**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph custom" -->

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: NAnt and MSBuild
**NAnt** and **Ant** have a **similar syntax**, with only a few differences. **Microsoft** later introduced a variant called **MSBuild**, tightly **integrated into Visual Studio**, specializing in building **solutions**, handling dependencies, and managing projects:
<img src="assets/msbuild-example.webp">

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Maven
Maven simplifies Ant files by **assuming certain Java project layouts**. By favoring **"convention over configuration"**, it can handle various tasks like **build**, **deploy**, **test**, and **release** with just **one command**, often needing minimal XML configuration:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/pom-example.webp" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/maven-project-structure.webp" width="250"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some shortcomings:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->
- Projects **not following Maven's assumptions** can make achieving desired results **tricky**, **seen as a feature** by some.  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue-parent custom" -->
- To extend it, **coding is necessary**, but it **offers plugins** for nearly every desired functionality.  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue-parent custom" -->

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Rake
Rake, the **main Ruby build tool**, started as an experiment to **mimic Make** using an **internal Ruby DSL**. It handles **tasks** and **dependencies**. Since the scripts are standard Ruby code, you can use it's versatility as a **general-purpose programming language**:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/rake-example.webp" width="700"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/rake-dependency-example.webp" width="700"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

You can **refactor** and **modularize** builds in your regular development environment. Debugging is easy with the **standard Ruby debugger**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph custom" -->

Some disadvantages:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->
- You need to ensure a suitable runtime is available on your platform
- You have to interact with RubyGems

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Buildr, Gradle
New-gen build tools like Buildr, Gradle, and Gantt use **real programming languages** for build scripts.

Buildr is **based on Rake**, so anything you can do in Rake, you can do in Buildr. Moreover, Buildr seamlessly **replaces Maven**, sharing the **same conventions like filesystem layout**, **artifact specs**, and **repositories**. You can also **use Ant tasks**, with no setup needed.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph custom" -->

Gradle was designed for **multi-project builds**, often **large in scale**. It relies on a series of build **tasks** that can run **serially** or in **parallel**. It also supports incremental builds:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-parent-with-next custom" -->
<img src="assets/gradle-example.webp" style="border: 1px solid lightgray" width="550">

If you're starting **a new Java project** or seeking an **alternative to Ant or Maven**, consider **Gradle** or Buildr with **DSLs in Groovy**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph custom" -->

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Psake
Psake is an **internal DSL** written in **PowerShell**, which provides **task-oriented** dependency networks:

<img src="assets/psake-example.webp">

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Bazel (Google), Buck (Facebook), Pants (Twitter)
Three of the most popular **Monorepo tools** and **declarative build systems**.

Common concepts are:
- **Goals and Commands:** build, test, lint, check, fmt, export, run, audit, clean, coverage, ...
- **Rules, Targets:** cc_library, python_source, java_source, docker_image, java_library, protobuf_source, ...
- **BUILD files**

```console
$ ./pants test ::
```

```console
$ ./pants test example:tests@interpreter_constraints=py2
```

```BUILD
# BUILD file

python_test(
  name="tests",
  source="tests.py",
  interpreter_constraints=parametrize(py2=["==2.7.*"], py3=[">=3.6"]),
)
```

They support **multiple programming languages**, **incremental builds**, **heavy and distributed caching**, **parallelization**, **code generation**, **dependency management and visualization**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph custom" -->

---
## Monorepo (Reference: <a href="https://monorepo.tools/">monorepo.tools</a>)
A monorepo is a **single repository** containing **multiple distinct projects**, with **well-defined relationships**:

<img src="assets/monorepo-polyrepo.svg" width="550">

------
### Monorepo != Monolith
A good monorepo is the opposite of monolithic:

<img src="assets/monorepo-vs-monolith.webp">

------
### Polyrepo
A polyrepo is the current standard way of developing applications: **one repo per team, app, or project**. Typically, each repo has a **single build artifact** and a **simple build pipeline**.

<img src="assets/polyrepo-practice.svg" width="650">

The industry has moved to the polyrepo way of doing things for one big reason: **team autonomy**.

------
### Repository Management and Software Structure Organization Spectrums

<img src="assets/structure-and-repository-specturms.svg">

------
### Polyrepo Drawbacks
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Cumbersome code sharing
  - To share code across repos, you'd likely create a repo for shared code (CI, tools, dependencies, versioning, etc.).
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Significant code duplication
  - Teams avoid the trouble of setting up a shared repo, creating their own versions of common services and components in each repo.
- Costly cross-repo changes to shared libraries and consumers  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Inconsistent tooling
  - Each project uses its own set of commands for running tests, building, serving, linting, deploying, and so forth.

------
### Monorepo Benefits
- No overhead to create new projects  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- Atomic commits across projects  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- One version of everything  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Developer mobility
  - Developers can confidently contribute to other teams' applications and verify that their changes are safe.

It is **more than code & tools**. It changes your **organization** and the **way you think about code**. By adding **consistency**, **lowering the friction in creating new projects** and performing **large scale refactorings**, by facilitating **code sharing** and **cross-team collaboration**, it enhances your organization's **efficiency**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph custom" -->

------
### Monorepo Tools
As your **workspace grows**, the tools have to help you keep it **fast**, **understandable** and **manageable**:

### Monorepo Drawbacks
- Weak Multiple Languages Support  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - The ideal monorepo tool for one programming language may not be suitable for others.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - But, most monorepo tools support internal and external plugins.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Git submodules can be an option for managing multiple languages in a monorepo.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- VCS Tooling Challenges  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - The complexity and size of the codebase, which makes it difficult to understand, search, scale, and maintain.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Microsoft has released a Virtual File System (VFS) for Git to help manage the overload.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Limitations Around Access Control  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Your company may not want every engineer to have access to the entire codebase.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - GitHub and GitLab support CODEOWNERS file to define which team owns subdirectories in the repository.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Heavy Build Pipelines  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Many CI tools offer conditional stages based on directory changes, like SemaphoreCI's "change_in" and Jenkins' "changeset."  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

---
## Principles and Practices
Key build and deployment scripting principles apply universally, **regardless of the technology used**:
- Create a Script for Each Stage in Your Deployment Pipeline  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Do not have a single script for whole deployment pipeline.
- Use an Appropriate Technology to Deploy Your Application  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Use the right tool for automation, like Wsadmin for WebSphere Application Server, instead of a general-purpose scripting language.
- Use the Same Scripts to Deploy to Every Environment  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Complex deployment architectures may require simplifications for developer machines to work.
- Use Your Operating System's Packaging Tools [for Deployment]  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Debian and Ubuntu use the Debian package system, while RedHat, SuSE, and other Linux flavors use the RedHat package system. Windows users can use the Microsoft Installer system.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Commercial middleware servers may require special tools for deployments,  leading to the use of a hybrid approach.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - You can use platform-specific packaging systems like Ruby Gems, Python Eggs/Wheels, Perl's CPAN, etc., for distribution, but these are developer-centric, not for system administrators.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Ensure the Deployment Process Is Idempotent  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Leave the target environment in the same (correct) state, regardless of its initial state during deployment.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Otherwise, verify your deployment assumptions about the environment and stop the deployment if they're not met.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Tools like Puppet analyze the target environment's configuration and make necessary changes to sync it with the specified desired state in a declarative manner.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Evolve Your Deployment System Incrementally  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - You don't have to complete all steps at once. Creating a deployment script for the local development environment and sharing it with the team can save a lot of individual developer effort.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Then, refine these scripts for the acceptance test environment, allowing deployment and test execution.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

## Package Managers
<img src="assets/start-packaging-meme.webp" class="fragment start">

A package manager or package-management system is a set of tools that automates the **installation**, **upgrading**, **configuration**, and **removal** of computer programs for a computer consistently:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-parent-with-next custom" -->
<img src="assets/package-management.webp" width="1000">

### Language Specific and Language Agnostic Package Managers
Some **language specific** and **language agnostic package managers**:

## Deployment Scripting
Changes to **testing** and **production environments** should **only be made through an automated process**.

Along with the previous notes, also consider the following:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->
- **Deploying and Testing Layers**: It's essential to build on good known foundations. Before copying binaries to the filesystem, ensure the environment is prepared in these layers:
    <img src="assets/deploying-software-layers.webp" width="330">
- **Testing Your Environment's Configuration**: Provide a degree of confidence that the deployed layer is working:
    <img src="assets/deployment-testing-layers.webp" width="960">

## Tips and Tricks
- Always Use Relative Paths  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Absolute paths create a tight dependency between the configuration of a specific machine and your build process.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Minimize absolute paths by using relative paths in your system, relying on defined root paths like deployment and configuration roots, and overriding them as needed.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Eliminate Manual Steps  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" --> For many organizations, a "build script" is a printed document with a series of instructions like:

    ```text
    ...
    STEP 14. Copy all the dlls from the CDROM directory E:\web_server\dlls\ into   the   new
    virtual directory
    STEP 15. Open a command prompt and type: regsvr webserver_main.dll
    STEP 16. Open the Microsoft IIS Management console and click Create New   Application
    ...
    ```
  - "When you have to do it a second time." The third time you do something, it should be done using an automated process.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Build In Traceability from Binaries to Version Control  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Some packages such a JAR files can include metadata.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - You can use simple MD5 hashing.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Don't Check Binaries into Version Control as Part of Your Build  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - The rule of thumb is not to check in anything created as part of your build, test, and deploy cycle into source control.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Test Targets Should Not Fail the Build  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Flag failures and postpone build failure until after generating reports or running more tests.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Constrain Your Application with Integrated Smoke Tests  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Make sure the deployed version validates its configuration when it is installed.

---
## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
<img src="assets/infrastructure-as-code-meme.webp" class="fragment start">

Infrastructure as Code is the **managing** and **provisioning** of infrastructure through **code instead of through manual processes**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph custom" -->

IaC aids configuration management and helps you to **avoid undocumented**, **ad-hoc configuration changes**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph custom" -->

There are 2 ways to approach IaC:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->
- **Declarative**: **Keeps a list of the system objects' current state**, simplifying infrastructure management and enabling **automatic provisioning** of the desired infrastructure.
- **Imperative**: Specifies the **necessary commands** for achieving the desired configuration, requiring them to be executed in the **correct order**.

These are a few popular choices:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next custom" -->
- Chef
- Puppet
- Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
- Saltstack
- Terraform 
- AWS CloudFormation

------
### Ansible
Ansible is **agentless**, which means the nodes it manages do not require any software to be installed on them:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/ansible-usage.webp" width="700">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/ansible-playbook-schema.webp" width="700">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/ansible-playbook-example.webp" width="700">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Ansible can be both **declarative** and **procedural**-many modules work declaratively, while other modules prefer a procedural programming approach.

------
### Terraform
Terraform is an **agentless** infrastructure as code tool that enables you to safely and predictably **provision** and **manage infrastructure** in any cloud:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/terraform-architecture.webp"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/terraform-file.webp" width="400"></td>
  </tr>

## Summary
Improve automated build and deployment **step by step**. Identify and **automate the most painful steps** in the deployment pipeline iteratively.
