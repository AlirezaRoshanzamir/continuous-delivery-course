## Introduction
It is vital to script **building**, **testing**, and **packaging** applications when working on large or distributed teams (including open source projects), since **otherwise, it can take days to get a new team member up and running**.

Every modern platform has a way to run the build **from the command line**. Rails projects can run the default **Rake** task; .NET projects can use **MsBuild**; Java projects (if set up correctly) can use **Ant**, **Maven**, **Buildr**, or **Gradle**; and with **CMake** or **SCons**, not much is required to get a simple C/C++ project going. Just have your CI server run this command to create binaries and run tests.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

However, once your project gets more complex-you have **multiple components**, or **unusual packaging** needs-you'll need to roll up your sleeves and dive into build scripting.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

Deploying software into **testing and production environments** **is rarely** as simple as **dropping a single binary file** and requires a series of steps such as **configuring your application**, **initializing data**, **configuring the infrastructure**, **operating systems**, and **middleware**, **setting up mock external systems**, and so on.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

---
## An Overview of Build Tools
All build tools have a common core: They allow you to model a dependency network:

<img src="assets/build-dependency-network.png">

------
### Continued: An Overview of Build Tools
Build tool types:
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Task-oriented
  - Describe the dependency network in terms of a set of tasks
  - Such as Ant, NAnt, MSBuild
  - Keep no state between builds, so, less powerful and entirely unsuitable for compiling C++
  - Work fine for languages such as C# since the compilers for these languages have built-in logic for performing incremental builds
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Product-oriented
  - Describe things in terms of the products they generate
  - Such as Make (also supports _phony targets_ such as clean, install, and test), Bazel, Pants, and Buck (these three are almost mixed).
  - Keep their state in the form of timestamps on the files generated by each of the tasks
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Mixed
  - Such as Rake

<details>
<summary>Note</summary>
Mention the _cookie targets_ in Make.
</details>

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Make
Powerful product-oriented build tool capable of tracking dependencies within a build and building only those **components that are affected by a particular change**.

But, **it's hard to debug** complex Makefiles. A common convention adopted by teams working on large codebases is to create a Makefile for each directory, and have a top-level Makefile that recursively runs the Makefiles in each subdirectory (which is [considered harmful](https://accu.org/journals/overload/14/71/miller_2004/)):  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-parent-with-next" -->
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/makefile-example.png" width="600"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/recursive-makefile.png" width="250"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some other drawbacks:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next" -->
- OS specific (it depends on the shell)
- Whitespace can be significant under certain circumstances
- Doesn't provide for extensions to the core system

<img src="assets/makefile-syntax-meme.jpeg" class="fragment end" width="800">

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Ant
The runtime components of Ant are written in Java, but the Ant scripts are an **external DSL** written in **XML**. This combination gives Ant powerful cross-platform capabilities.
<img src="assets/ant-example.jpg" width="700">

Some shortcomings:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next" -->
- XML is neither succinct nor pleasant for humans to read.  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- There are no real domain concepts over and above a task.  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- You cannot easily ask questions about Ant tasks, such as "How many tests ran?" and "How long did they take?".  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- While supports reuse through the import and macrodef tasks, these are poorly understood by novice users.  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->

As a result of these limitations, Ant files tend to be long and poorly factored-it is not unusual to be **thousands of lines long**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: NAnt and MSBuild
NAnt uses essentially the **same syntax as Ant, with only a few differences**. **Microsoft** later introduced its **minor variation on NAnt** and called it MSBuild which is more **tightly integrated into Visual Studio**, understanding how to build Visual Studio solutions and projects and how to manage dependencies.

<img src="assets/msbuild-example.png">

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Maven
Maven attempts to **remove a large amount of boilerplate** found in Ant files by having a more complex domain that makes **many assumptions about the way your Java project is laid out**. This principle of favoring **convention over configuration** means that, so long as your **project conforms to the structure dictated by Maven**, it will perform almost any **build**, **deploy**, **test**, and **release** task you can imagine with **a single command**, without having to write more than a few lines of XML:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/pom-example.jpg" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/maven-project-structure.webp" width="250"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some shortcomings:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next" -->
- If your project doesn't conform to Maven's assumptions about structure and lifecycle, it can be hard to make Maven do what you want (this could be considered a feature).  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- To extend it, you need to write code. However, it has plugins for almost everything you'd want to do.  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Rake
The dominant Ruby build tool, Rake, came about as an experiment to see if **Make**'s functionality could be easily reproduced by creating an **internal DSL** in Ruby. Rake has no understanding of anything except **tasks** and **dependencies**. However, since Rake scripts are plain Ruby, you can **use Ruby's API** to carry out whatever tasks you want. You have all the native power of a general-purpose programming language at your disposal:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/rake-example.png" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/rake-dependency-example.png" width="500"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

You can **refactor** and **modularize** your builds, and you can use your **regular development environment**. It is straightforward to debug Rake **using the standard Ruby debugger**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

Some disadvantages:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next" -->
- You have to ensure that a decent runtime is available on your platform
- You have to interact with RubyGems

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Buildr, Gradle
The new generation of build tools, such as Buildr, Gradle, and Gantt, have taken the approach of **using real programming languages** for build scripts.

Buildr is built on **top of Rake**, so everything you can do in Rake you can continue to do in Buildr. However, Buildr is also a drop-in **replacement** for Maven-it **uses the same conventions that Maven does**, including **filesystem layout**, **artifact specifications**, and **repositories**. It also lets you **use Ant tasks** (including any custom ones) with zero configuration.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

Gradle was designed for **multi-project builds**, which can grow to be large. It operates based on a series of build **tasks** that can run **serially** or in **parallel**. Incremental builds are supported:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-parent-with-next" -->
<img src="assets/gradle-example.png" style="border: 1px solid lightgray">

If you're starting **a new Java project**, or looking for **a replacement for Ant or Maven**, we strongly suggest you consider **Gradle**, or Buildr with **DSLs in Groovy**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Psake
Psake is an **internal DSL** written in **PowerShell**, which provides **task-oriented** dependency networks:

<img src="assets/psake-example.png">

------
### An Overview of Build Tools: Bazel (Google), Buck (Facebook), Pants (Twitter)
Three of the most popular **Monorepo tools** and **declarative build systems**. Three common concepts are:
- **Goals and Commands:** build, test, lint, check, fmt, export, run, audit, clean, coverage, ...
- **Rules, Targets, and BUILD files:** cc_library, python_source, java_source, docker_image, java_library, protobuf_source, ...

```console
$ ./pants test ::
```

```console
$ ./pants test example:tests@interpreter_constraints=py2
```

```BUILD
# BUILD file

python_test(
  name="tests",
  source="tests.py",
  interpreter_constraints=parametrize(py2=["==2.7.*"], py3=[">=3.6"]),
)
```

They support **multiple programming languages**, **incremental builds**, **heavy and distributed caching**, **parallelization**, **code generation**, **dependency management and visualization**.

## Monorepo (Reference: <a href="https://monorepo.tools/">monorepo.tools</a>)
A monorepo is a single repository containing multiple distinct projects, with well-defined relationships:

<img src="assets/monorepo-polyrepo.svg" width="550">

------
### Monorepo != Monolith
A good monorepo is the opposite of monolithic:

<img src="assets/monorepo-vs-monolith.png">

------
### Polyrepo
A polyrepo is the current standard way of developing applications: a repo for each team, application, or project. And it's common that each repo has a single build artifact, and simple build pipeline:

<img src="assets/polyrepo-practice.svg" width="650">

The industry has moved to the polyrepo way of doing things for one big reason: **team autonomy**.

------
### Repository Management and Software Structure Organization Spectrums

<img src="assets/structure-and-repository-specturms.svg">

------
### Polyrepo Drawbacks
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Cumbersome code sharing
  - To share code across repositories, you'd likely create a repository for the shared code (CI, tooling, dependency, versioning, ...).
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Significant code duplication
  - No one wants to go through the hassle of setting up a shared repo, so teams just write their own implementations of common services and components in each repo.
- Costly cross-repo changes to shared libraries and consumers  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Inconsistent tooling
  - Each project uses its own set of commands for running tests, building, serving, linting, deploying, and so forth.

------
### Monorepo Benefits
- No overhead to create new projects  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- Atomic commits across projects  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- One version of everything  <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" -->
- <!-- .element class="fragment highlight-current-blue" --> Developer mobility
  - Developers can confidently contribute to other teams' applications and verify that their changes are safe.

It is **more than code & tools**. A monorepo changes your **organization** and the **way you think about code**. By adding **consistency**, **lowering the friction in creating new projects** and performing **large scale refactorings**, by facilitating **code sharing** and **cross-team collaboration**, it'll allow your organization to work more **efficiently**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

------
### Monorepo Tools
As your workspace grows, the tools have to help you keep it fast, understandable and manageable:

### Monorepo Drawbacks
- Weak Multiple Languages Support
  - The best monorepo tool for one programming language is not good for the others.
  - Most monorepo tools support internal and external plugins.
  - You should consider Git submodule for multiple languages.
- VCS Tooling Challenges  <!-- .element class="fragment fade-in" -->
  - The complexity and size of the codebase, which makes it difficult to understand, search, scale, and maintain.
  - Microsoft has released a Virtual File System (VFS) for git to help manage the overload.
- Limitations Around Access Control  <!-- .element class="fragment fade-in" -->
  - Your company may not want every engineer to have access to the entire codebase.
  - GitHub and GitLab support CODEOWNERS file to define which team owns subdirectories in the repository.
- Heavy Build Pipelines  <!-- .element class="fragment fade-in" -->
  - Many CI tools offer the capability of conditional stages that execute only when changes occur in a particular directory. For instance, SemaphorCI uses "change_in," while Jenkins employs "changeset" to implement this functionality.

---
## Principles and Practices
Some general principles and practices of build and deployment scripting should apply to **whichever technology you use**:
- Create a Script for Each Stage in Your Deployment Pipeline  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Do not have a single script for whole deployment pipeline  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Use an Appropriate Technology to Deploy Your Application  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Use the right tool for the job when automating deployment, not a general-purpose scripting language. For example, for WebSphere Application Server, you can use the Wsadmin tool.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Use the Same Scripts to Deploy to Every Environment  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - If your application is complex in terms of its deployment architecture, you will have to make some simplifications to get it working on developer machines.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Use Your Operating System's Packaging Tools [for Deployment]  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - For example, Debian and Ubuntu both use the Debian package system; RedHat, SuSE, and many other flavors of Linux use the RedHat package system; Windows users can use the Microsoft Installer system, and so forth.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Commercial middleware servers, for example, often require special tools to perform deployments. In this case, a hybrid approach is necessary.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - You can also use platform-specific packaging systems, such as Ruby Gems, Python Eggs/Wheels, Perl's CPAN, and so on, to distribute your application, but they are designed by and for developers, not system administrators.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Ensure the Deployment Process Is Idempotent  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Leave the target environment in the same (correct) state, regardless of the state it finds it in when starting a deployment.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - If you cannot do this, validate the assumptions your deployment process makes about the environment, and fail the deployment if they are not met.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Tools such as Puppet analyzes the configuration of the target environment and makes only the necessary changes to bring it in sync with the declarative specification of the desired state of the environment  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Evolve Your Deployment System Incrementally  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - You don't have to have completed all of the steps at once. The first time you write a script to deploy the application in a local development environment and share it with the team, you have saved lots of work for individual developers.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Then, move on to refining these scripts so they can be used in the acceptance test environment to deploy and run the application so that the tests can be run.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->

## Package Managers
<img src="assets/start-packaging-meme.jpg" class="fragment start">

A package manager or package-management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of **installing**, **upgrading**, **configuring**, and **removing** computer programs for a computer in a consistent manner.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-parent-with-next" -->

## Deployment Scripting
Changes to testing and production environments should **only be made through an automated process**.

In addition to the previous mentioned notes, the following should be considered:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next" -->
- **Deploying and Testing Layers**: You should strive to build on good known foundations. Before we even bother to copy our binary deliverables to the correct place in the filesystem, we want to know that our environment is ready for us in these layers:
    <img src="assets/deploying-software-layers.png" width="300">
- **Testing Your Environment's Configuration**: Provide a degree of confidence that the deployed layer is working:
    <img src="assets/deployment-testing-layers.png" width="850">

Mention the "Smoke-Testing N-Tier Architecture" through simple HTTP requests and displaying the results.

## Tips and Tricks
- Always Use Relative Paths  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Absolute paths create a tight dependency between the configuration of a specific machine and your build process.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - Try to minimize absolute paths by making all of the paths in your system relative to one or more well-defined root paths-the deployment root, the configuration root, and so on-and overriding just these roots.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Eliminate Manual Steps  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" --> For many organizations, a "build script" is a printed document with a series of instructions like:

    ```
    ...
    STEP 14. Copy all the dlls from the CDROM directory E:\web_server\dlls\ into   the   new
    virtual directory
    STEP 15. Open a command prompt and type: regsvr webserver_main.dll
    STEP 16. Open the Microsoft IIS Management console and click Create New   Application
    ...
    ```
  - "When you have to do it a second time." The third time you do something, it should be done using an automated process.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Build In Traceability from Binaries to Version Control  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Some packages such a JAR files can include metadata.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
  - You can use simple MD5 hashing.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Don't Check Binaries into Version Control as Part of Your Build  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - The rule of thumb is not to check in anything created as part of your build, test, and deploy cycle into source control.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Test Targets Should Not Fail the Build  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Make the failure set a flag but fail the build later, after generating more useful reports or running a more complete set of tests.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
- Constrain Your Application with Integrated Smoke Tests  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->
  - Make sure the deployed version validates its configuration when it is installed.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
<img src="assets/infrastructure-as-code-meme.jpg" class="fragment start">

Infrastructure as Code is the **managing** and **provisioning** of infrastructure through **code instead of through manual processes**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment insides-fade-in-then-out" -->

IaC aids configuration management and helps you to **avoid undocumented**, **ad-hoc configuration changes**.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

There are 2 ways to approach IaC:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next" -->
- **Declarative**: Keeps a list of the current state of your system objects, which makes taking down the infrastructure simpler to manage and will automatically provision the desired infrastructure.
- **Imperative**: Defines the specific commands needed to achieve the desired configuration, and those commands then need to be executed in the correct order.

These are a few popular choices:  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-with-next" -->
- Chef
- Puppet
- Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
- Saltstack
- Terraform 
- AWS CloudFormation

------
### Ansible
Ansible is **agentless**, which means the nodes it manages do not require any software to be installed on them:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/ansible-usage.png" width="700">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/ansible-playbook-schema.png" width="700">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/ansible-playbook-example.png" width="700">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Ansible can be both **declarative** and **procedural**-many modules work declaratively, while other modules prefer a procedural programming approach.

------
### Terraform
Terraform is an **agentless** infrastructure as code tool that enables you to safely and predictably **provision** and **manage infrastructure** in any cloud:

## Summary
Grow your automated build and deployment capabilities **step by step**, working through the deployment pipeline by iteratively identifying and then **automating the most painful steps**.

Involve **both operations and developers** in the creation of the mechanisms.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

We use the term "script" in quite a **broad sense**. Generally, by this we mean **all the automation** that helps us **build**, **test**, **deploy**, and **release** our software.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

Scripts are **first-class** parts of your system. They should be **version-controlled**, **maintained**, **tested**, and **refactored**, and be the **only mechanism that you use to deploy** your software.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->

Spend some time, think about the **goals** you want to achieve, and **design** your build and deployment process to attain them.  <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-paragraph" -->
