## Introduction
There are differences between releasing software into production and deploying it to testing environments—not least, in the level of adrenaline in the blood of the person performing the release. However, in technical terms, these differences
should be encapsulated in a set of conﬁguration ﬁles.

The main difference between deploying and releasing is the ability to roll back. Two extremely powerful techniques that can be used to perform zero-downtime releases and rollbacks on even the largest of production systems are:
- Blue-green deployments
- Canary releasing

## Creating a Release Strategy
The most important part of creating a release strategy is for the application's stakeholders to meet up during the project planning process. They should consider:
- Parties in charge of deployments to each environment, as well as in charge of the release.
- An asset and conﬁguration management strategy.
- A description of the technology used for deployment.
- A plan for implementing the deployment pipeline.
- An enumeration of the environments available for acceptance, capacity, integration, and user acceptance testing.
- Requirements for monitoring the application.
- A discussion of the method by which the application's deploy-time and runtime conﬁguration will be managed.
- Description of the integration with any external systems.
- Details of logging.
- A disaster recovery plan.
- The service-level agreements for the software.
- Production sizing and capacity planning.
- An archiving strategy
- How the initial deployment to production works.
- How ﬁxing defects and applying patches to the production environment will be handled.
- How upgrades to the production environment will be handled.
- How application support will be managed.

------
### The Release Plan
The ﬁrst release is usually the one that carries the highest risk; it needs careful planning. The results of this planning may be automated scripts, documentation, or other procedures needed to reliably and repeatedly deploy the application into the production environment. It usually includes:
- Deploy steps
- Deployment tests
- Back out steps
- Backup and restore application's state
- Upgrade application without destroying the state
- Restart and redeploy steps
- Logs location
- Monitoring
- Data migration

------
### Releasing Products
One class of software projects where you must consider other issues is software destined to be released as a commercial product. Here's a list of additional deliverables that should be considered if the output of your project is a software product:
- Pricing model
- Licensing strategy
- Copyright issues around third-party technologies used
- Packaging
- Marketing materials—print, web-based, podcasts, blogs, press releases, conferences, etc.
- Product documentation
- Installers
- Preparing sales and support teams

## Deploying and Promoting Your Application
The key to deploying any application in a reliable, consistent manner is constant practice.

------
### The First Deployment
One of the principal goals of the ﬁrst iteration of a project is to get the early stages of our deployment pipeline running and to be able to deploy and demonstrate something, no matter how small, at the end.

This is one of the very few situations where we recommend prioritizing technical value over business value. You can think of this strategy as priming the pump of your development process.

At the end of this pump-priming iteration, you should have the following in place:
- Your deployment pipeline's commit stage
- A production-like environment to deploy to
- An automated process that takes the binaries created by your commit stage and deploys them into the environment
- A simple smoke test that veriﬁes that the deployment worked and the application is running

In general, a production-like environment has the following characteristics:
- Has same operating system as the production system
- Same software installed as the production system will-and in particular, none of the development toolchain (such as compilers or IDEs) should be installed on it.
- Managed the same way as the production environment
- In the case of client-installed software, should be representative of your clients' hardware statistics.

------
### Modeling Your Release Process and Promoting Builds
Promoting builds between environments requires to consider the following concerns:
- What stages a build has to go through in order to be released (for example, integration testing, QA acceptance testing, user acceptance testing, staging, production)
- What the required gates or approval are
- For each gate, who has the authority to approve a build passing through that gate

------
### Orchestration
Environments are often shared between several applications:
- New deployment of an application should not disturb the operation of any other applications (you might consider using some form of virtualization technology)
- If applications sharing the environment depend on each other, system integration testing (SIT) helps.

------
### Deployments to Staging Environments
Before you let your application loose on unsuspecting users, you should perform some ﬁnal tests in a staging environment that is very similar to production.

For simple systems without interaction with external systems, you can employ the capacity testing environment for both capacity testing and staging.

## Rolling Back Deployments and Zero-Downtime Releases
It is essential to be able to roll back a deployment in case it goes wrong.

There are several methods of performing a rollback. The more advanced techniques such as blue-green deployments and canary releasing can also be used to perform zero-downtime releases and rollbacks.

There are two important constraints:
- Data: If your release process makes changes to your data, it can be hard to roll back.
- Other systems: releases involving more than one system (known as orchestrated releases), the rollback process becomes more complex.

Rolling back principles:
- Ensure that the state of your production system, including databases and state held on the ﬁlesystem, is backed up
- Practice your rollback plan, including restoring from the backup or migrating the database back before every release

------
### Rolling Back by Redeploying the Previous Good Version
The simplest way to get back to a good state is to redeploy the previous good version from scratch.

------
### Zero-Downtime Releases (Hot Deployment)
The key to zero-downtime releases is decoupling the various parts of the release process so they can happen independently as far as possible. it
should be possible to put in place new versions of shared resources your applications depend on, such as _databases_, _services_, and _static resources_, before you upgrade your applications.

You can use versioning for static resources and web-based services:
- For example, AWS has a date-based versioning system, with the latest version of the EC2 API available at `http://ec2.amazonaws.com/doc/2009-11-30/AmazonEC2.wsdl`.
- Put the static resources such as images, Javascript, HTML, and CSS to a new directory-for example, you could put the images for version 2.6.5 of your application under `/static/2.6.5/images`.

We talk about database later.

------
### Blue-Green Deployments
Have two identical versions of your production environment, which we'll call blue and green:

It is usually not possible to switch over directly from the green database to the blue database because it takes time to migrate the data from one release to the next if there are schema changes:
- Put the application into read-only mode shortly before switchover
- Take a copy of the green database and restore it into the blue database
- Perform the migration
- Switch over to the blue system
- Put the application back into read-write mode
You can also migrate database independent of the the upgrade process which we describe later.

If you can only afford a single production environment, you can still use blue-green deployments. Simply have two copies of your application running side by side on the same environment (but isolated to each other).

You can use your staging and production environments as your blue and green environments (shadow domain releasing, shadow environment releasing, or live-live releasing).

------
### Canary Releasing
If you have an extremely large production environment, it's impossible to create a meaningful capacity testing environment.

Canary releasing is defined as rolling out a new version of an application to a subset of the production servers to get fast feedback:

<img src="assets/canary-releasing.jpg">

- Initially deploy the new version of the application to a set of servers where no users are routed to.
- Do smoke tests and, if desired, capacity tests, on the new version.
- Start to route selected users (power users) to the new version of the application.

Benefits:
- Easy rollback by resetting routing
- A/B testing
- Gradually ramping up the load to check the capacity requirements

Finally, it is important to keep as few versions of your application in production as possible-try to limit it to two.

## Emergency Fixes
There comes a moment when a critical defect is discovered and has to be ﬁxed as soon as possible:
- Do not, under any circumstances, subvert your process (such as logging directly into production environments and making uncontrolled changes).
  - The change is not tested properly, which may exacerbate the problem.
  - The environment ends up in an unknown state that makes it impossible to reproduce.

Some other considerations:
- Sometimes it's better to roll back to the previous version than to deploy a ﬁx.
- Never do them late at night and pair with somebody else.
- Make sure you have tested your emergency ﬁx process.
- Only under extreme circumstances circumvent the usual process for making changes to your application.
- Make sure you have tested making an emergency ﬁx using your staging environment.

---
## Continuous Deployment
The logical extreme is to deploy every change that passes your automated tests to production (by making the final step automatic). This technique is known as continuous deployment (**to production**).

It can be combined with canary releasing to reduce risk.

The intuitive objection to continuous deployment is that it is too risky. You can't do it without a comprehensive, reliable set of automated tests. If you have good reasons for not releasing
every change you make-and there are less such reasons than you might think-you should behave as if you were going to do so.

---
## Tips and Tricks
- The People Who Do the Deployment Should Be Involved in Creating the Deployment Process
- Log Deployment Activities
- Don't Delete the Old Files, Move Them
  - You can use the symbolic link technique
- Deployment Is the Whole Team's Responsibility
- Server Applications Should Not Have GUIs
- Have a Warm-Up Period for a New Deployment
  - Until the caches are full, the application will often have a poor response time and may even fail.
- Fail Fast
  - The system should perform the checks as it initializes, and if it encounters an error, it should fail to start.
- Don't Make Changes Directly on the Production Environment
  - Production environments should be completely locked down, so that only your deployment pipeline can make changes to it.

---
## Summary
The latter stages of the deployment pipeline are all concerned with deploying into testing and production environments. Your implementation should make it possible to
deploy any version of your application that has made it past the automated tests into any of your environments at the push of a button, given the correct credentials. It should be possible for everyone on your team to see exactly what is deployed where, and what changes are included in that version.

Nevertheless, for a system of any size and complexity, the ﬁrst release into production will always be a momentous occasion. It is vital to have thought about the process and planned for it sufﬁciently to make it as straightforward as possible.

The most crucial part of release planning is assembling representatives from every part of your organization involved in delivery: build, infrastructure, and operations teams, development teams, testers, DBAs, and support personnel.
